Enter the name and description of the group and select a stablecoin that the user will be allowed to deposit.

A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to a stable asset, such as the US dollar, to reduce price volatility. Stablecoins aims to provide a more stable and predictable investment option compared to other cryptocurrencies, which can be highly volatile.

Using stablecoins makes it easier to track user deposits because of the reduced volatility. This helps to increase transparency and accountability in the investment process and ensures that all users can track their investments accurately.
