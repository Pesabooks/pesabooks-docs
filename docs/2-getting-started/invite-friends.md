# Reach out to your friends

<!-- ![](/img/form-group.png) -->

Once you create the group, your friends will receive an email inviting them to join the group.

As the organizer, is up to you to get everyone to join. The group wallet cannot be deployed before all members have accepted the invitation.

You can remove invitees who are not ready to join and invite new members

## Manage invitations

You can manage invitations through the Members page by clicking on `Members` in the sidebar menu
