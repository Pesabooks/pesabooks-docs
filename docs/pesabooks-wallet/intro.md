# Pesabooks Wallet

Pesabooks wallet is a non-custodial wallet and authentication tool that streamline onboarding through passwordless sign-on and automated wallet creation.

Powered by [web3auth](https://web3auth.io/), Pesabooks Wallet uses cryptographic techniques to provide a secure, private, and transparent way to store and manage digital assets.

<!-- The private key is divided into multiple parts and stored across multiple devices or locations, making it much more difficult for a single party to access or control the assets (even us). This helps to ensure that the assets are protected from theft, hacking, or other forms of unauthorized access. -->
